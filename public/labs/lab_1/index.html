        <p> They're all having a grand time.</p>
        
        <h2> Random Facts</h2>
        <p> Here are some random facts in the form of an unordered list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> I'm addicted to Genshin Impact right now.</li>
            <li> I'm knitting a blanket, but I'm running out of yarn and 
                 it's turning out more like a very thick table runner.</li>
            <li> I cook chicken katsu pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like books.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Julia's Top 5 Albums</h2>
        <p> If this question were about our top 5 favorite <em>songs</em>, 
            I think it would look much different.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Good For You - Amine </li>
            <li> WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? - Billie Eilish </li>
            <li> Get You - Daniel Caesar
            <li> Fine Line - Harry Styles</li>
            <li> woah - push baby</li>
        </ol>   

        <h2> Poem of The Day </h2>
        <p> The woods are lovely, dark and deep <br/>    
            But I have promises to keep <br/>   
            And miles to go before I sleep, <br/>   
            <strong>And miles to go before I sleep.</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>- Robert Frost</strong></em></p>
        
        <hr/>

        <p> This is the last stanza from Frost's poem, <em>Stopping by Woods on 
            a Snowy Evening.</em> This is also the last part of the page. So,
        thanks and have a good day!</p>
